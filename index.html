                <p>Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under
                    the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of
                    the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free
                    and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The

                <h3>Transforming Eduction in India</h3>
                <p>Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.While a consensus over what is the
                    most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have
                    attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a dissatisfaction with the
                    quality of public schools, greater affordability of private schools, and
                    non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools. After the adoption of the
                    Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognised'. A
                    private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions</p>

                <p>We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions
                    whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions,
                    in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the
                    country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and
                    to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population
